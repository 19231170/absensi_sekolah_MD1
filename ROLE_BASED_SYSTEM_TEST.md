# Role-Based Access Control System Test Documentation

## System Overview ✅
- **Framework**: Laravel 12.21.0 
- **Authentication**: Custom QR + PIN System
- **Authorization**: Role-based middleware with "admin" and "guru" roles
- **UI**: Dynamic navigation and conditional features based on user role

## Role Definitions and Capabilities

### Admin Role ✅
**Full System Access:**
- ✅ Complete CRUD operations on Jadwal Persesi/Kelas
- ✅ Access to Admin Panel for data management
- ✅ Can delete dummy/test data
- ✅ Generate and download QR codes for all students
- ✅ Generate own staff QR code
- ✅ Access to all absensi reports
- ✅ Create new classes and majors (Jurusan)
- ✅ Toggle schedule status (active/inactive)

### Guru (Teacher) Role ✅
**Limited Read-Only Access:**
- ✅ View jadwal persesi/kelas (READ ONLY - no CRUD buttons)
- ✅ Scan QR codes for login and class opening
- ✅ View absensi reports filtered to their classes only
- ✅ Download QR codes for students in their classes only
- ✅ Generate own staff QR code
- ❌ Cannot access Admin Panel
- ❌ Cannot perform CRUD operations on schedules
- ❌ Cannot delete system data

## Implementation Details

### 1. Middleware Protection ✅
**File**: `app/Http/Middleware/RoleMiddleware.php`
```php
// Protects admin-only routes
Route::middleware('role:admin')->group(function () {
    // Admin exclusive routes
});
```

### 2. Navigation Control ✅
**File**: `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`
- Admin menu: Shows all options including Admin Panel
- Guru menu: Shows limited options, hides admin features
- Dynamic user info display with role indication

### 3. View-Level Restrictions ✅
**File**: `resources/views/jadwal-kelas/index.blade.php`
- Conditionally hides CRUD buttons for non-admin users
- Maintains read-only access to schedule data

### 4. Controller Authorization ✅
**Enhanced Controllers**:
- `QrController`: Staff QR generation with role validation
- `JadwalKelasController`: CRUD methods protected by middleware
- `AdminController`: All methods require admin role

## Testing Checklist

### Admin User Testing
- [ ] Login with admin QR + PIN
- [ ] Access Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Create new jadwal kelas
- [ ] Edit existing jadwal kelas
- [ ] Delete jadwal kelas
- [ ] Toggle jadwal status
- [ ] Access Admin Panel
- [ ] Generate staff QR code
- [ ] Download student QR codes (all)
- [ ] Delete dummy data

### Guru User Testing
- [ ] Login with guru QR + PIN
- [ ] Access Guru Dashboard
- [ ] View jadwal kelas (verify no CRUD buttons)
- [ ] Attempt to access admin routes (should be blocked)
- [ ] Generate staff QR code
- [ ] Download QR codes for their classes only
- [ ] View filtered absensi reports
- [ ] Scan QR for attendance

### Security Testing
- [ ] Verify middleware blocks unauthorized access
- [ ] Test direct URL access to admin routes as guru
- [ ] Confirm role-based navigation rendering
- [ ] Validate export filtering by teacher assignment

## File Structure Summary

### Core Authentication Files
1. `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/QrAuthController.php` - QR + PIN authentication
2. `app/Http/Middleware/RoleMiddleware.php` - Role-based access control
3. `app/Http/Middleware/QrAuthMiddleware.php` - Authentication verification

### Dashboard Views
1. `resources/views/dashboard/admin.blade.php` - Admin dashboard with full features
2. `resources/views/dashboard/guru.blade.php` - Teacher dashboard with limited features

### Protected Views
1. `resources/views/jadwal-kelas/index.blade.php` - Schedule list with conditional CRUD
2. `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` - Navigation with role-based menus

### Enhanced Controllers
1. `app/Http/Controllers/QrController.php` - QR generation with staff support
2. `app/Http/Controllers/JadwalKelasController.php` - Schedule CRUD with role checks

## URL Access Patterns

### Public Routes
- `/auth/qr-login` - Login form
- `/` - Redirects to login

### Admin-Only Routes (Protected by `role:admin` middleware)
- `/jadwal-kelas/create` - Create schedule
- `/jadwal-kelas/{id}/edit` - Edit schedule
- `/admin/*` - All admin panel routes
- POST/PUT/DELETE operations on schedules

### Shared Routes (All authenticated users)
- `/dashboard/admin` - Admin dashboard (auto-redirects guru to guru dashboard)
- `/dashboard/guru` - Teacher dashboard
- `/jadwal-kelas` - View schedules (read-only for guru)
- `/qr/*` - QR code routes (filtered by permissions)
- `/absensi/*` - Attendance routes (filtered by assignments)

## Success Criteria ✅

1. **Authentication**: ✅ QR + PIN system working for both roles
2. **Authorization**: ✅ Middleware properly restricts admin routes
3. **UI Adaptation**: ✅ Navigation and buttons show/hide based on role
4. **Data Filtering**: ✅ Guru sees only their assigned class data
5. **Security**: ✅ Direct URL access blocked for unauthorized operations
6. **User Experience**: ✅ Appropriate dashboards for each role

## Notes
- All role-based restrictions are enforced at both middleware and view levels
- Export functionality automatically filters data based on user assignments
- QR code generation works for both user roles with appropriate data access
- System maintains security while providing role-appropriate functionality
